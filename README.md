## About   
Oxylus is a simple yet powerful data-driven game engine built in C++ with a focus on developer productivity and performance. It is free and will be open-source forever!

Be aware that Oxylus is still in it's early stages of development. Some important features and documentation might be missing. Oxylus will have many API breaking changes both on C++ and Lua. Only use if you're okay with these.

## Design Goals
- **Powerful**: Full support for both 2D and 3D development
- **Intuitive**: Beginner-friendly yet endlessly adaptable for power users
- **Data-Driven**: Built on an Entity Component System (ECS) for efficient data handling
- **Modular**: Modular designâ€”use only the parts you need, swap out the rest
- **Fast**: Optimized for speed with parallel processing where possible

## Feature Highlights 
- Modular Vulkan renderer built using [vuk](https://github.com/martty/vuk) with modern rendering features:
	- Meshlet Rendering
	- GI with [Brixelizer](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-brixelizer/)
	- [GTAO](https://github.com/GameTechDev/XeGTAO)
	- [SSSR](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-sssr/)
	- [AMD FSR 3](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-super-resolution-3/)
	- PCF Cascaded Directional, Spot and Point Light Shadows
	- Physically Based Bloom
	- Depth Of Field 
	- HDR
	- Tonemapping 
	- Chromatic Aberration
	- Film Grain
	- Vignette
	- Sharpen
	- and many more various post-processing effects.
	- 2D Pipeline
		- Animated sprites
		- Tilemaps
- Multithreaded physics with [Jolt](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics).   
- Lua scripting with [flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) events and systems.
	- Automatic component reflection with [sol3](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) and flecs.
- A featureful editor built with [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to aid the development process. 
- 3D Audio with [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio)

## Building
Windows, Linux and Mac (with MoltenVK) is supported.

### Requirements
- [Xmake](https://xmake.io)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).
- A compiler that supports C++23.   
### Steps
- To configure the project run:
  - `xmake f --toolchain=clang --runtimes=c++_static -m debug`
	- Change `--toolchain=` for the toolchain you want to use. 
	- Pick a mode `-m debug, release, dist`
	- Optionals:
      - `--lua_bindings` Compile lua bindings (`true` by default)
      - `--profile` Enable tracy profiler (`false` by default)
- To build the project run:
	- `xmake build`
- To run the editor with xmake run:
  - `xmake r OxylusEditor`
- Or to manually run it make sure to copy required binaries in `/build/bin` to executable directory created by this command:
	- `xmake install -o ./build`
